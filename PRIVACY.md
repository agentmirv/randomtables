# Privacy Policy

The Random Tables add-on does not collect or distribute any information about you, the document upon which add-on is installed, or the spreadsheets the add-on accesses. 

This add-on requests permissions to do the following:  

**View and manage your Google Docs documents**  
This permission is needed so that the add-on can write text into the document where the add-on is installed. Text is written to the document only after pressing one of the buttons in the add-on sidebar. After a Google Sheet URL is successfully loaded from the sidebar load textbox, the URL is saved as a document property so that the load textbox can be automatically repopulated when the sidebar is re-opened. If the load button is pressed when the load textbox is empty, the document property is deleted.

**See, edit, create, and delete your spreadsheets in Google Drive**  
This permission is needed so that the add-on can populate the sidebar with buttons that, when pressed, access certain cells of the spreadsheet as input and output parameters of a function implemented in the spreadsheet. 

**Display and run third-party web content in prompts and sidebars inside Google applications**  
This permission is needed so that the add-on can display a sidebar so that the load textbox can be shown. The load textbox is provided with the Google Sheet URL and, once the spreadsheet is loaded, the sidebar is populated with buttons the user can click.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**  
I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
This policy is effective as of 2020-05-29
